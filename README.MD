# React Design:Demo Templates created by Nick Kaufmann :

## NJK Productions site launching on Netlify
## App is meant for learning purposes and to show how I implement certain design aspects only. Feel free to take and reuse, but I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE for any code on here, nor do I claim to be some grand designer that created these. All my work is inspired from people I respect and admire, and even those I work with. Use at your own risk.
